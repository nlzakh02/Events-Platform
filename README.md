## Events Platform

The overarching goal of this assignment is to build an [eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) like web site.  
The main focus is on developing and deploying backend microservices.


### Part 1

In this part of the assignment we built a first version of the API for accesing the Catalog microservice.

### Part 2 & 3

At this point, we added the Web Application (Model-View-Controlller) microservice to enable user interaction with the Catalog microservice.  
We added Identity microservice (based on IdentityServer4 framework) for user authorization and integrated it with Web Application.
Cart and order microservices were also added and integrated with the Web Application.
